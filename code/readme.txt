Thanking for checking out the code used to create the InternIt website!

How to run the project:
This project can be run using any web-browser though there will not be any database functionality unless the database is up and running, 
a user account has been set up, and the credentials for said user account have been placed inside config.php

Development platform used:
ICEcoder was used as our development environment which is an online code editor that ran on our virtual machine.

File structure:
After creating a subfolder in the ROOT folder, these files should be placed all in that folder.
